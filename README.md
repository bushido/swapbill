# Introduction

SwapBill is an 'embedded' cryptocurrency protocol and cryptocurrency, currently at the preview stage,
and supporting embedding in bitcoin testnet and litecoin testnet.

This project is a (pure python) reference client for the SwapBill protocol.

# Requirements

To run the SwapBill reference client you'll need:

* Python version 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4
* The third party Python 'ecdsa' and 'requests' modules
* The bitcoin reference client ('Bitcoin Core') set up and running as an RPC server, and/or
* The litecoin reference client ('LitecoinQT') set up and running as an RPC server

The code has been tested on Linux and Windows, but should work on any platform with support for the litecoin reference client and the
required Python dependencies.
